I am a software engineer in the Bay Area with over 5 years of experience working at
fast-paced startups. Previously, I worked at [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) on
the Security and Anti-fraud teams and at [Color](https://color.com) as part of the
Data Platform team. My interests include a variety of topics at the intersection of
software engineering, computer science, and biology.

Before becoming a software engineer, I briefly pursued a PhD at Stanford, where I published a
[few papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0P0fVwQAAAAJ&hl=en)
on rare genetic variation, gene regulation, and the heritability of complex traits.
Although I had the opportunity to collaborate with excellent mentors and peers,
I realized academia wasn’t the right path for me and left with a master’s degree in March 2019.

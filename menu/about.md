I am a software engineer at [Color](https://www.color.com/) on the data platform team. My interests include a variety of topics at the intersection of software engineering, computer science, and biology.

Previously, I did a short stint in the Stanford PhD program where I published a [few papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0P0fVwQAAAAJ&hl=en) on rare genetic variation, gene regulation, and the heritability of complex traits. While I was lucky to work with excellent mentors and peers, I decided academia is not for me and left with a masters in March of 2019.

I am a software engineer at [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) on the security team.
Previously, I worked on the data science team at [Color](https://color.com). My interests
include a variety of topics at the intersection of software engineering, computer science,
and biology.

Before I worked as a software engineer, I did a short stint in the Stanford PhD program
where I published a [few papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0P0fVwQAAAAJ&hl=en)
on rare genetic variation, gene regulation, and the heritability of complex traits. While
I was lucky to work with excellent mentors and peers, I decided academia is not for me
and left with a masters in March of 2019.

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University. My interests include a wide variety of topics at the intersection of computer science, biology, and medicine, such as rare genetic variation, the heritability of complex traits, and regulatory genomics.

In 2016, I received a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University. Before my work in genomics, I worked as a production assistant at Four Directions Productions. I also worked as a software engineer for the Python Software Foundation, Yahoo! Research - Latin America, and Facebook.
